Upon oral administration, AZD9291 covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. AZD9291 preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily-acquired resistance mutation, and may have enhanced anti-tumor effects in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGF',\n",

Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis upon treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53-deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.',\n",

To assess the response rate (RR) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\\r\\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the OS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\\r\\nIII. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine and the combination of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide, respectively, in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\\r\\n\\r\\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\\r\\nI. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of proliferation Ki-67 index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.

To assess the prognostic significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to treatment. (Laboratory)\\r\\nIII. To assess the agreement in Ki-67 status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by central pathology review. (Laboratory)\\r\\n\\r\\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nARM A: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14.

Patients also receive etoposide IV on days 1-3.

In Phase 1b, this includes patients whose disease has progressed on\\n      standard of care therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. In Phase 2, enrollment\\n      criteria regarding prior treatment(s) received varies by tumor type.

Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies is optional for\\n             subjects in dose escalation\\n\\n          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at trial entry\\n             and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months\\n\\n          -  Disease must be measurable with at least 1 uni-dimensional measurable lesion by RECIST\\n             1.1, except for subjects with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or\\n             metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who may be enrolled with objective evidence of disease\\n             without a measureable lesion\\n\\n          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol\\n\\n          -  Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception\\n             exists\\n\\n          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply\\n\\n        Inclusion Criteria for expansion phase:\\n\\n          -  Subjects must have relapsed, refractory, or progressive disease following last line of\\n             treatment (with the exception of the gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)\\n             cancer cohort, which does not require progression). Availability of tumor archival\\n             material or fresh biopsies (excluding bone biopsies) is mandatory for eligibility in\\n             the expansion cohorts. For subjects in the MBC cohort, the biopsy or surgical specimen\\n             must have been collected within 90 days prior to the first investigational medicinal\\n             product (IMP) administration. Specifically, the following will be required:\\n\\n          -  NSCLC post platinum doublet: Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or\\n             stage IV NSCLC that has progressed after 1 line of platinum-containing doublet\\n             chemotherapy. Subjects should have received only 1 line of platinum-containing\\n             treatment for metastatic disease (i.e., adjuvant treatment with a platinum-containing\\n             regimen is not sufficient for eligibility because not received in the context of a\\n             metastatic disease). Subjects in the NSCLC cohort will only be enrolled in USA\\n\\n          -  NSCLC first line: Stage IV (per 7th International Association for the Study of Lung\\n             Cancer [IASLC] classification) or recurrent NSCLC that is histologically proven.\\n             Subjects must not have received treatment for their metastatic or recurrent disease.\\n             No activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation nor ALK\\n             translocation/re-arrangement\\n\\n          -  Gastric and GEJ cancer: Histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or\\n             metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastric and gastro-esophageal junction, treated with\\n             first-line chemotherapy combination with or without disease progression. Subjects\\n             should have received no more than 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease. Subjects\\n             should not have been treated with trastuzumab (but can be Human Epidermal growth\\n             factor Receptor 2 [HER2] positive). Subjects who received any platinum containing\\n             doublet or triplet as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy, but are not ultimately\\n             candidates for surgery will also be eligible, as long as they did not have progressive\\n             disease after completion of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, subjects with\\n             gastric cancer can enter in the study if their white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte\\n             count is as defined in the protocol\\n\\n          -  MBC: Subjects must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or MBC and have\\n             tumor that is refractory to or progressive after standard of care therapy. Subjects\\n             must have received no more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic\\n             disease.
